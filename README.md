# TureON  : *Turing machine visualization*


The Turing Machine Visualization project is a web application project named as
“TureON” which is designed to help individuals understand the inner workings of
a Turing machine. It visualizes the concept of Theory of Computation through
Turing Machines. We plan to implement a website so that users can create an
account after which a platform will be provided for them where they can create,
save and update their own Turing machines for various problems.
